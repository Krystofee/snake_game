# Snake Game Project

This repository contains the code for a classic Snake game implemented using the Pygame library.

## Instructions

1. **Objective**: Control the snake to eat the food appearing on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake runs into itself.
2. **Controls**: Use the arrow keys or `WASD` keys to change the direction of the snake:
   - Up: `Up Arrow` or `W`
   - Down: `Down Arrow` or `S`
   - Left: `Left Arrow` or `A`
   - Right: `Right Arrow` or `D`
3. **Starting Length**: The snake starts out with a length of 3 blocks.
4. **Food and Score**: Each piece of food the snake eats increases its length by 1 block and increments the score by 1.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake runs into itself. The final score is displayed in the terminal.
